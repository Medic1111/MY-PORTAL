[OH_THE_PANDEMIC]

- During the pandemic when kids were virtually schooled, I has the opportunity to experience what my teenager son goes through in this new gen of education.

- For the most part, there are no texts books anymore like back when I was his age. Everything is now online and through the school's website.

[NO_HOMEWORK_DONE]

- Observing my son's lack of motivation to stay focused and organized, I decided to investigate further and asked him to get into the school portal: Where classes, grades and assignments are displayed.

- After observing the literal headache it was, traveling from page to page to page to finally end-up in a very clumsy personal agenda, I understood his struggles better.

[THE_SOLUTION]

- If using a paper agenda is a 'no-go' for kids nowadays (as he told me), then why not an app that's simple and easy to use while accomplishing the goal of helping to stay on track?
